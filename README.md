## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- java script
- [SASS](https://sass-lang.com/) - For styles

### Continued development

- clamp() function to set min and max width it's really flexible to manage the element easily
- sass to practice it more

### Useful resources

- [clamp()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/clamp) - This helped me to set the card width to be responsive with the screens responsive
- [picture element tag](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/picture) - this helped me to set another scr to the divider src with setsrc attribute on respoinsve screens
